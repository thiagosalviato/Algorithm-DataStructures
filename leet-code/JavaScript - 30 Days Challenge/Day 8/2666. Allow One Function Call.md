## 2666. Allow One Function Call

### Description:
Given a function ```fn```, return a new function that is identical to the original function except that it ensures ```fn``` is called at most once.

- The first time the returned function is called, it should return the same result as ```fn```.
- Every subsequent time it is called, it should return ```undefined```.



### JavaScript Solution:
```JavaScript
const once = (fn) => {
    let result;
    let used = false;

    return function(...args) {
        if (!used) {
            result = fn(...args);
            used = true;
            return result;
        }
        return undefined;
    };
};
```
