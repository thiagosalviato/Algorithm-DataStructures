## 2676. Throttle

### Description:
Given a function fn and a time in milliseconds t, return a ```throttled``` version of that function.

A ```throttled``` function is first called without delay and then, for a time interval of ```t``` milliseconds, can't be executed but should store the latest function arguments provided to call ```fn``` with them after the end of the delay.

For instance, ```t = 50ms```, and the function was called at ```30ms, 40ms, and 60ms```. The first function call would block calling functions for the following t milliseconds. The second function call would save arguments, and the third call arguments should overwrite currently stored arguments from the second call because the second and third calls are called before ```80ms```. Once the delay has passed, the throttled function should be called with the latest arguments provided during the delay period, and it should also create another delay period of ```80ms + t```.

### JavaScript Solution:
```JavaScript
const throttle = (fn, t) => {
    let id = null;
    return function(...args) {
        const currTime = Date.now();
        const remainingTime = nextExecTime - currTime;
        if (remainingTime <= 0) {
            clearTimeout(id);
            fn(...args);
            nextExecTime = currTime + t;
        } else {
            clearTimeout(id);
            id = setTimeout(() => {
                fn(...args);
                nextExecTime = currTime + t;
            }, remainingTime);
        }
    };
};
```
