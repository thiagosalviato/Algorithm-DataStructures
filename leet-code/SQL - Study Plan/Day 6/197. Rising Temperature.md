```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
```

id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.


Write an SQL query to find all dates' ```Id``` with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in ```any order```.

The query result format is in the following example.

### SQL Solution:
```sql
SELECT t1.id
FROM Weather t1
INNER JOIN Weather t2
ON t1.recordDate = DATE_ADD(t2.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
WHERE t1.temperature > t2.temperature;
```
