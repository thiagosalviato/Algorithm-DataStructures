Write an SQL query to report all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

### SQL Solution:
```sql
SELECT c.name as Customers
FROM Customers c
WHERE c.id NOT IN (SELECT customerId FROM Orders);
```

### SQL Solution (Second Version - Optimized):
```sql
SELECT c.name as Customers
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.id = o.customerId
WHERE o.customerId IS NULL;
```
