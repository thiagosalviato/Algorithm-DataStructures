Table: Products
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+
```

product_id is the primary key for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.


Write an SQL query to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

### SQL Solution:
```sql
SELECT c.name as Customers
FROM Customers c
WHERE c.id NOT IN (SELECT customerId FROM Orders);
```

### SQL Solution (Second Version - Optimized):
```sql
SELECT p.product_id
FROM (  SELECT product_id
         FROM Products
         WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y'
     ) AS subq
JOIN Products p ON p.product_id = subq.product_id;
```
