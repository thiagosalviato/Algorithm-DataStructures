Table Activities:
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| sell_date   | date    |
| product     | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
```
There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table contains the product name and the date it was sold in a market.


Write an SQL query to find for each date the number of different products sold and their names.

The sold products names for each date should be sorted lexicographically.

Return the result table ordered by ```sell_date```.

The query result format is in the following example.

### SQL Solution:
```sql
SELECT sell_date, COUNT(DISTINCT(product)) as 'num_sold',GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT(product) SEPARATOR  ',') AS products
FROM Activities
group by sell_date
order by sell_date, product;
```

### SQL Solution (Second Version - Optimized):
```sql
SELECT a.sell_date,
       COUNT(DISTINCT a.product) AS num_sold,
       p.products
FROM Activities a
         JOIN (
    SELECT sell_date, GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product) AS products
    FROM Activities
    GROUP BY sell_date
) p ON a.sell_date = p.sell_date
GROUP BY a.sell_date
ORDER BY a.sell_date, p.products;
```
