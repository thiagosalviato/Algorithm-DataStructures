Write an SQL query to find for each user, the join date and the number of orders they made as a buyer in 2019.

Return the result table in ```any order```.

The query result format is in the following example.

### SQL Solution:
```sql
SELECT u.user_id AS buyer_id, u.join_date AS join_date, SUM(CASE WHEN LEFT(o.order_date, 4) = '2019' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS orders_in_2019
FROM Users u
         LEFT JOIN Orders o ON u.user_id = o.buyer_id
GROUP BY u.user_id;
