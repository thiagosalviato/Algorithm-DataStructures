+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |

Table: Rides
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| user_id       | int     |
| distance      | int     |
+---------------+---------+
```

id is the primary key for this table.
user_id is the id of the user who traveled the distance "distance".


Write an SQL query to report the distance traveled by each user.

Return the result table ordered by travelled_distance in ```descending order```, if two or more users traveled the same distance, order them by their name in ```ascending order```.

The query result format is in the following example.

### SQL Solution:
```sql
WITH total_distance AS (
    SELECT user_id, COALESCE(SUM(distance), 0) AS td
    FROM rides
    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT name, COALESCE(td, 0) AS travelled_distance
FROM users
         LEFT JOIN total_distance ON users.id = total_distance.user_id
ORDER BY travelled_distance DESC, name ASC;
```
