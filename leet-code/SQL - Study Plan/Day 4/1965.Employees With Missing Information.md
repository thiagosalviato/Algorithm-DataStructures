Table: Employees

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
```
```employee_id``` is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of the employee whose ID is employee_id.


Table: Salaries

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| salary      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
```
```employee_id``` is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the salary of the employee whose ```ID``` is employee_id.


Write an SQL query to report the IDs of all the employees with ```missing information```. The information of an employee is missing if:

The employee's ```name``` is missing, or
The employee's ```salary``` is missing.
Return the result table ordered by employee_id ```in ascending order```.

### SQL Solution:
```sql
SELECT e.employee_id FROM Employees e
    LEFT JOIN Salaries s ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id
    WHERE s.salary IS NULL
UNION
SELECT s.employee_id FROM Salaries s
    LEFT JOIN Employees e ON s.employee_id=e.employee_id
    WHERE e.name IS NULL
ORDER BY employee_id;
```
