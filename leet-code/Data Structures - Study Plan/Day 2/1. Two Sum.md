## 1. Two Sum

### Description:
Given an array of integers ```nums``` and an integer ```target```, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to ```target```.

You may assume that each input would have ```exactly one solution```, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

### JavaScript Solution:
```JavaScript
const twoSum = (nums, target) => {
    let storage = {};

    for(let [index,num] of nums.entries()){
        if(storage[num] !== undefined) return [storage[num],index];
        storage[target-num] = index;
    }
};
```
