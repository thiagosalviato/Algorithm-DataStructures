## 1779. Find Nearest Point That Has the Same X or Y Coordinate

### Description:
You are given two integers, ```x``` and ```y```, which represent your current location on a Cartesian grid: ```(x, y)```. You are also given an array ```points``` where each ```points[i] = [ai, bi]``` represents that a point exists at ```(ai, bi)```. A point is ```valid``` if it shares the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate as your location.

Return the index ```(0-indexed)``` of the ```valid``` point with the smallest ```Manhattan distance``` from your current location. If there are multiple, return the valid point with the ```smallest``` index. If there are no valid points, return -1.

The ```Manhattan distance``` between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2).

### JavaScript Solution:
```JavaScript
const nearestValidPoint = (x, y, points) => {
    let nearest = Infinity;
    let index = -1;

    points.forEach(([pointsX, pointsY], i)=>{

        if(pointsX!==x && pointsY !== y) return

        const distanceX = Math.abs(pointsX-x);
        const distanceY = Math.abs(pointsY-y);

        if( distanceX + distanceY < nearest) {
            nearest = distanceX+distanceY;
            index = i;
        }

    });

    return index;
};
```
