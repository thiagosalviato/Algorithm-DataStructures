## 202. Happy Number

### Description:
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A ```happy number``` is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it ```loops endlessly in a cycle``` which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process ```ends in 1``` are happy.

Return ```true``` if ```n``` is a happy number, and ```false``` if not.


### Java Solution:
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
        while (n != 1 && !seen.contains(n)) {
            seen.add(n);
            int sum = 0;
            while (n > 0) {
                int numberDigit = n % 10;
                sum += numberDigit * numberDigit;
                n /= 10;
            }
            n = sum;
        }
        return n == 1;
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Solution:
```JavaScript
const isHappy = (n) => {
    let seen = new Set();
    while (n !== 1) {
        let sum = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            let numberDigit = n % 10;
            sum += numberDigit * numberDigit;
            n = Math.floor(n / 10);
        }
        if (seen.has(sum)) {
            return false;
        }
        seen.add(sum);
        n = sum;
    }
    return true;
};
```
