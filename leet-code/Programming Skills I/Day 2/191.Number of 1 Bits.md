## 191. Number of 1 Bits

### Description:
Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the ```Hamming weight```).


### Java Solution:
```Java
public class Solution {
    public static int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int numbersOne = 0;
        while(n!=0) {
            numbersOne = numbersOne + (n & 1);
            n = n>>>1;
        }
        return numbersOne;
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Solution:
```JavaScript
const hammingWeight = (n) => {
    const str = n.toString(2);
    let count = 0;
    for (let char of str) {
        if (char === "1") count++;
    }
    return count;
};
```
